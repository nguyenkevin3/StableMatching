Project: Stable Matching Algorithm and Verifier

Team:
  1) Kevin Nguyen 93349993
  2) Noelio Perez 77647747

Instructions to compile: **g++ required to build**
  1) Clone the repository
  2) Navigate to project directory
  3) Run: g++ matchingengine.cpp -o matchingengine
  4) Drag and drop input files into the directory (example.in is already provided)
  5) Run: ./matchingengine

Instructions to use matcher and verifier:
  1) You will be asked to enter an input file, type the name (ex: example.in)
  2) You will be asked to enter an output file to be generated, type the name (ex: test.out)
  3) If you want to verify the matching, type 'y', else type 'n'
  4) If yes, the verifier will output the validity and stability of the matching.

Scalability:
